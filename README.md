# Physics-Informed-NN
This repository is dedicated to exploring and understanding the implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

Currently, I am working on reproducing the results from the following papers:
- Raissi, M., Perdikaris, P., & Karniadakis, G. E. (2017). Physics informed deep learning (part i): Data-driven solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations. arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.10561.
- Raissi, M., Perdikaris, P., & Karniadakis, G. E. (2017). Physics informed deep learning (part ii): Data-driven discovery of nonlinear partial differential equations. arXiv 2017. arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.10566.

The goal is to replicate the paperâ€™s results to gain deeper insights into how PINNs solve nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) effectively through data-driven approaches.
